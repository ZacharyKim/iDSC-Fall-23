# Illinois Data Science Club Spring 2023 Team Avalanche Project

## Introduction
- U.S. job market shaped by economy, society, and tech.
- COVID-19 emphasized sector resilience, especially in tech.
- Remote work and innovation became crucial.
- Economic, social, tech, and global factors influence employment.
- Key for success: Adaptability, digital literacy, continuous learning.


## Goals
- Forecast next year's employee rate for 76 Fortune 500 companies. This information helps a company understand how financial decicisons effect their employees
- Show how different sectors have perfomred within the past few years. This information helps job seekers find a sector that will keep them instead of laying them off
- Project shows how the employment rate for each company and industry sector has increased/decreased based on financial performance, size of company, location and other inter-company decisions.

## Roadblock
we origanlly wanted to do tech layoff rates and how a company's finances effects those rates. However after merging and cleaning the two datasets there only seven companies so we changed our project idea to overall employee rates based off of 76 randomly chosen fortune 500 companies

## Methodology
1. searched for database
2. cleaned the databse
3. analyzed dataset/ made visuals

From this data, we can see that there were a large amount of employees layed off in 2020. This is due to many companies having to layoff employees due to COVID-19. The large dip in 2022 is mainly caused by the Amazin layoffs as they layed off 67,000 employees that year

**Conclusion:** <br>
If only one variable changes while everything else stays the same then the employee rate doesn't change much. This means that there isn't one factor that causes a change in employment. The employee rate change is caused by a combination of all these factors combined
